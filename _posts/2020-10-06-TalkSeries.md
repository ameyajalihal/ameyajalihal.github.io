# Lots of talks these days.

I find that I attend as many as four talks a week, which is slightly higher than the number of talks I would attend in more precedented times. I have enjoyed being able to explore new areas by attending these series.

Here is a short list of series that I try to attend. 

1. The most excellent [Cell size and growth](https://researchseminars.org/seminar/size-and-growth) series.

2. [IDP seminars](http://idpseminars.com/), which is interesting because it is still a relatively young community.

3. I have attended a couple of [IDPsig seminars](https://idpsig.weebly.com/about.html), but haven't been as regular as I'd have liked.

4. CMB's exciting Fall short course on imaging techniques. [Flyer](https://github.com/ameyajalihal/ameyajalihal.github.io/tree/master/assets/Fall2020CMB630Flyer.pdf).

5. The sturday morning [Proteinopathy talks](https://rams.biop.lsa.umich.edu/symposium_1).

6. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the [POBAM talks](https://easychair.org/cfp/POBAM2020) over the summer. Will be on the look out for more in this series.

7. I'm looking forward to the [ASCB virtual meeting](https://www.ascb.org/cellbiovirtual2020/) in December.

Holler if you see my name in the attendee list, or if there is a series you think I'd be interested in!
