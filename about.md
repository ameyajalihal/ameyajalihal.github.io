Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Amy Gladfelter's lab at Duke University](https://gladfelterlab.net/). I study the evolution of membraneless compartments in cells and how large, mulitnucleate cells such as fungi coordinate morphogenesis with growth and nuclear divisions. 

I did my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology at the University of Michigan. For my PhD work, I used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy tools to study how protein translation is regulated by spatially reorganizing the cytosol of cancer cells under the mentorship of [Prof. Nils Walter](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/walter-lab/).

Outside the lab, I enjoys coffee and classical Indian music (like a true Chennai native), cooking, being outdoors (I ran my first full marathon in 2023!) and making art.

Say hello at ameya dot jalihal at duke dot edu.
