Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Amy Gladfelter's lab at UNC Chapel Hill. I study the evolution of phase separated condensates and how these structures impacts the growth and morphology of a multinucleate fungus.

I was previously a Cell and Molecular Biology graduate student at the University of Michigan. For my PhD work, I used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy tools to study how protein translation is regulated by spatially reorganizing the cytosol of cancer cells under the mentorship of [Prof. Nils Walter](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/walter-lab/).

Outside the lab, I enjoys coffee and classical Indian music (like a true Chennai native), cooking, being outdoors and thinking about representation and identity.

Say hello at ajalihal at unc dot edu.
